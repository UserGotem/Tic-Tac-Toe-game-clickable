## Current Features

* Simple clickable interface for making moves
* Detection of winning combinations
* Display of the current player's turn (X or O)

## Planned Improvements

* Implement a more sophisticated AI opponent
* Introduce a difficulty level selector
* Add a game history feature to track past moves
* Enhance the user interface with visual feedback and animations
